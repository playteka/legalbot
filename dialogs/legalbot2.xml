2. Generate confirmation (with a reference number) that the information has been forwarded to [internal control department/ compliance department] for validation and authorization, stating that the respondent will receive an answer shortly.
3. An automatic email is generated with the information in 1 attached and sent to [internal control department/ compliance department] with the title “Covered Funds Control: Permitted Investment (Not a Covered Fund: Registered Investment Company)” and the following paragraph in the body:
“[Name] ([email address]), from [Unit, Department or Trading Desk] (the “Requester”) requests authorization to transact with [full legal name of Issuer], LEI [Legal Entity Identifier of Issuer] (“Issuer”), on the basis that the Issuer is an investment company registered as such in the US and is therefore not a covered fund pursuant to the Volcker Rule.
Evidence in support attached.
Ref.[reference number here]”
4. If the evidence in support is correct and sufficient and there are no other reasons to deny the request, the [internal control department/compliance department] should authorize the transaction. Perhaps to do that the automatically generated email will have “authorize”/”deny” buttons that will trigger an automatic response to the requester and their boss?</item>
